            <h2>What's Changed - A Brief History</h2>
                <div class="version-content">
                    <p>Before digital computing, scientific and engineering modeling and simulation relied on slow and labor-intensive manual calculations, physical experimentation, and mechanical analog devices. After World War II, digital computers helped create the first era of computational simulation characterized by the development of numerical methods used to solve previously intractable problems. The Monte Carlo method enabled statistical simulation of nuclear processes, and finite element analysis allowed engineers to model real world behavior across a range of scenarios.</p>
                    <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, we witnessed the commercialization of simulation as early research software transitioned to industry. This era saw the emergence of specialized modeling and simulation companies like ANSYS, Autodesk, and Abaqus. Engineers could now iterate through dozens of design variations computationally, and replacing some of their physical prototyping. However, simulations often required over-simplified models due to computation constraints and rudimentary text-based interfaces that demanded specialist operators. Separate tools were also largely disjoint—an electronics engineer used one tool, a mechanical engineer another, with little coupling between disciplines.</p>
                    <p>The 1990s and 2000s represented greater mainstream adoption as CAD and CAE systems converged, multiphysics capabilities emerged, and user accessibility improved through early graphical interfaces. High-performance computing further allowed tackling increasingly complex and useful problems.</p>
                    <p>Since then, we've seen incremental improvements in similar capabilities at the largest software companies in hardware engineering, with few new entrants. Historically, incumbents had "little incentive to innovate, buoyed by entrenched agreements, high switching costs, and a lack of competition"
                    <span class="info-tooltip">
                        <span class="info-icon-small">i</span>
                        <span class="tooltip-text">Scale Venture Partners. "Building the Next Generation of Hardware: Why AI-Powered Engineering Tools Matter." https://www.scalevp.com/insights/building-the-next-generation-of-hardware-why-ai-powered-engineering-tools-matter/</span>
                    </span>.</p>
                    <p>Despite decades of progress, design, experiment, and simulation tools today still face fundamental limitations that create opportunities for new approaches. Traditional software has grown more capable but not necessarily simpler—many tools require deep domain knowledge to set up correctly, and companies struggle to find or train the right talent to use these advanced tools effectively. Also, different departments often use simulation packages that don't communicate with each other, forcing engineers to spend significant time transferring data between tools and ensuring consistency. Furthermore, while hardware has become more powerful, simulations have grown in ambition proportionally, meaning high-fidelity analyses can still consume days to weeks on large compute clusters. Additionally, high-end simulation software remains expensive in both licensing and required hardware, limiting democratization of the technology.</p>

                    <p>The convergence of several technological developments is now enabling new approaches to address these persistent challenges. AI-powered surrogate models can provide nearly instant predictions for a range of problems that traditionally required hours or days of computation, with some results showing >10-10,000x speed improvements. Cloud computing is making simulations more accessible and scalable, as well as enabling better data-sharing and collaboration. AI can also help embed expert knowledge to automate setup steps and reduce the expertise threshold required for advanced simulations, potentially “democratizing” these tools to a much broader user base.</p>

                    <p>This technological maturation creates a unique window for new entrants. As one industry analysis notes, "to truly capture this moment, these paradigm shifts call for new platforms built with native functionality, not legacy add-ons, creating a unique opportunity for emerging players to reshape the field.” Rather than retrofitting AI capabilities onto decades-old architectures, new companies can build physics-AI platforms from the ground up, where artificial intelligence is fundamental to how the software approaches scientific experimentation and engineering problems. Time will tell if such entrants can “either integrate seamlessly with legacy systems or provide compelling enough value propositions to overcome incumbents' entrenched positions.”

To give one example: In Y Combinator's 2025 call for startups, they specifically highlight the need to "modernize CAD/CAM with AI assistance, simplify complex engineering tools, and create accessible design validation tools with a focus on physics simulation acceleration"
                    <span class="info-tooltip">

            <h2>Defining the Physics-Infused AI Market</h2>
            <p>Physics-infused AI represents an emerging category at the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and engineering workflows. This rapidly evolving space includes many overlapping terms, including physics-informed AI, physics-aware AI, scientific machine learning, and simulation intelligence—reflecting its multidisciplinary nature and broad applications. I use the term "physics-infused" to encompass both discovery workflows (particularly inverse problem solving) and design workflows (generative design combined with simulation).
                <span class="info-tooltip">
                    <span class="info-icon-small">i</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">The term draws from the broader concept of "simulation intelligence" as described in: Lavin, A., Krakauer, D., Zenil, H., Gottschlich, J., Mattson, T., Brehmer, J., Anandkumar, A., Choudry, S., Rocki, K., Baydin, A. G., Prunkl, C., Paige, B., Isayev, O., Peterson, E., McMahon, P. L., Macke, J., Cranmer, K., Zhang, J., Wainwright, H., . . . Pfeffer, A. (2021, December 6). *Simulation Intelligence: towards a new generation of scientific methods*. arXiv.org. https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03235</span>
                    <p>The scope of physics-infused AI in science and engineering spans a vast range of disciplines, from quantum computing and chemistry to industrial simulation and civil engineering. Here, I focus primarily on applications in the life and physical sciences, as well as mechanical and electrical engineering. Given the primary bottlenecks of data integration, simulation compute complexity, and software expertise thresholds, I segment the market along two key dimensions: research-heavy versus tech-agnostic approaches, and specialized versus generalized models. This framework yields four primary types of functions and services:</p>
                    <p><strong>Deep Physics Solvers</strong> (Research-Heavy + Specialized) lead the development of novel algorithms for specific domains like advanced CFD or quantum chemistry, building high technical moats through specialized expertise.</p>

                    <p><strong>Foundation Model Builders</strong> (Research-Heavy + Generalized) develop universal physics simulators and cross-domain models that can tackle multiple physics problems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Universal Platforms</strong> (Tech-Agnostic + Generalized) offer multi-physics platforms and simulation orchestration tools that integrate various physics domains.</p>

                    <p><strong>Domain Platforms</strong> (Tech-Agnostic + Specialized) provide user-friendly tools for specific physics areas, democratizing access to specialized simulation capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Shifting Value Proposition</h3>
            <p>There are indicators that AI tools are changing the business case for simulation. While improved product performance has historically been the primary driver—cited by 87% of R&D leaders in a 2021 McKinsey survey
                <span class="info-tooltip">
                    <span class="info-icon-small">i</span>
                    <span class="tooltip-text">McKinsey & Company. (2021). *Unveiling the next frontier of engineering simulation*. https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/unveiling-the-next-frontier-of-engineering-simulation</span>
                </span> — future priorities are shifting. Time-to-market acceleration is emerging as the top expected value driver, reflecting how simulation is evolving from a specialized analysis tool into a standard engineering workflow component.</p>            
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <img src="images/bus-case.svg" alt="Business case for simulation - shifting value drivers from performance to time-to-market" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
            </div>
            
            <p>This shift indicates a change in how organizations deploy simulation capabilities. As the research suggests, when simulation is expensive and difficult, companies focus their limited capacity on solving complex performance problems. As tools become faster and more accessible, organizations increasingly use simulation to streamline and accelerate the entire product development process.</p>
        
            <h3>The AI Adoption Gap</h3>
            <p>Despite growing interest, a significant implementation gap exists in AI-enhanced simulation. While three-quarters of R&D leaders consider digital product development essential, only 5% have fully integrated AI and ML methods into their processes. However, over 60% are actively experimenting through proof-of-concept or pilot projects, suggesting the market is at an inflection point.</p>
            
            <p>Industry adoption varies widely, with automotive leading at 76% AI/ML usage compared to 47% in machinery and fabricated metals (not including the sciences). Meanwhile, academic interest is accelerating rapidly—research papers on deep learning surrogates for numerical simulation alone increased thirty-fold between 2016 and 2021, indicating strong foundational development" and expansion in the sciences.</p>

            <h2>Attributes of Winning Companies</h2>

            <h3>Competitive Dynamics with Incumbents</h3>
            <p>The competitive landscape presents a complex dynamic rather than a simple disruption narrative. Incumbent simulation companies maintain significant advantages: established customer relationships spanning decades, deep integration into existing workflows, substantial R&D budgets, and proven ability to acquire emerging technologies. Companies like ANSYS, Autodesk, and Siemens have market capitalizations in the tens of billions and generate substantial recurring revenue from their installed bases.</p>
            
            <p>However, incumbents face structural challenges in adopting AI-first approaches. Their legacy architectures and business models—built around expensive software licenses and consulting services—create conflicts when introducing dramatically faster, potentially cheaper alternatives. Additionally, their large organizations and diverse product portfolios can slow innovation cycles compared to focused startups.</p>
       
            <h3>Leveraging the Current Market Moment</h3>
            <p>Successful companies are positioning themselves to capitalize on a unique market dynamic: larger enterprises are actively experimenting with physics-AI tools, often providing their own proprietary data to help develop models for internal use cases. This creates multiple pathways to successful market penetration, some of which may include 1) Some companies are succeeding as specialized add-ons that demonstrate such clear value that users advocate for broader platform adoption within their organizations. 2) Others are making their platforms sufficiently accessible—with lower learning curves and faster time-to-insight, such that engineers can experiment and prove value before requiring enterprise procurement processes. 3) Some companies are creating technical moats by building the best models through bespoke ML development using customers' proprietary data, establishing deeper partnerships and defensible competitive advantages. Success appears to depend on either seamlessly integrating with existing incumbent tools to enhance rather than replace current workflows, or delivering compelling enough performance improvements or expansion in capabilities to justify switching costs and workflow disruption despite incumbent advantages. </p>

            <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
            
            <p>Physics-infused AI represents a promising but still-nascent category at the intersection of artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and engineering workflows. While early demonstrations show impressive technical capabilities—from multiple orders of magnitude simulation speedups to novel materials discovery workflows—translating these proof-of-concepts into sustainable businesses remains an open question.</p>
            
            <p>The market opportunity is substantial if these tools can deliver on their promise of democratizing advanced simulation and enabling new workflows previously constrained by computational limitations. However, significant challenges remain: maintaining physics accuracy at speed, integrating with entrenched engineering workflows, and competing against well-resourced incumbents with established customer relationships. Success will likely require not just technical breakthroughs, but also careful navigation of complex enterprise sales cycles and workflow integration challenges.</p>
